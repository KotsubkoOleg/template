![Bundle your files more quickly with Parcel JS](https://i.imgur.com/D7ggQBB.png)

Parcel.js is billed as a "zero configuration" bundler. It can transform and compile your HTML, SCSS, JS and many other file types, with a minimum of time spent setting up a config file.

If you're just working on a simple front-end web app and don't require a lot of control over your build, you can swap in Parcel for WebPack or Gulp.

## How to install Parcel

You can install Parcel either using npm or yarn. You'll also need to create a package.json file. 

*Note: if you don't have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, you will need to do that before following these steps!*

**yarn:**
```
yarn
yarn dev
yarn build
```
